# Vinyls2
This is my synoptic 3 project for my apprenticeship. It is called Vinyls 3 and is a catalogue of vinyls I own.
I am using express and mongoose for the api. I am using mongodb in dockerimage to host my database.
I am using Robo3t to view my database collections
I am using Postman to see the request and response of the api statements
I am using Winston to log all errors, and info logs
I am using eslint for linting checks
I am using Jest for unit testing
